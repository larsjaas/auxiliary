# auxiliary.app

This is a small OSX utility I wrote to monitor when PleX player is launched or quit, and make sure AU Lab.app is also launched and quit at the same time.

It is based on the AppleScript in the forum thread called [Stereo Dynamic Range Compression (normalize audio levels) for PHT Mac
](https://forums.plex.tv/discussion/98756/stereo-dynamic-range-compression-normalize-audio-levels-for-pht-mac)
It did not work for me out of the box, nor do I particularly enjoy the AppleScript language, so I decided to roll my own in plain Obj-C Cocoa.

You are free to use this utility as is, and to rework it as you see fit.
